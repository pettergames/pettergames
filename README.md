Hello world! Yes, I went there. Sorry.

Anyway, my name is Petteri and I'm yet another long-time gamer who's finally taking some steps towards "doing everything myself if I want it done right". 

In practice this currently means dedicating what free time I have, between my current day job and being a dad and a spouse, to refresh my memory on scripting basics (there were classes in C++ and HTML back in school...) while picking up new things mostly through Unity tutorials and trial&error practicing. On the side learning Blender to complement with asset design etc. as it'll probably come in handy in the future, but that's another story.

The initial half-joke about getting things done myself aside, I'm mostly driven by a desire to create, coming up with concepts and bringing them to life and just doing something that I actually find interesting and engaging (and fun, most of the time). Hoping to get to a point where I can actually consider releasing something of my own design and start building up a portfolio that'd allow me to focus on creating full-time - while I'd love to achieve that by the end of the year 2021, I'm a enough of a realist to know it can take at least a couple of years to get from here to there.

And that's it (me) in a nutshell.
